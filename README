Finally, an update to the very outdated mod_blog that's been available since
September 3, 2009.  There still isn't much documentation because, as of yet.
I doubt what's here is enough but for the most dedicated to go through the
code to see how this works.

REQUIREMENTS

        If you don't meet these requirements, then you probably won't get
        very far.  The software was written in C (don't bother asking for
        Perl code---there isn't any, and there won't be any) and as such,
        makes certain assumptions, such as:
        
                * Linux (or any POSIX compilant UNIX system)
                * GCC   (or any C99 compiler that may come with your system)
                * Apache
                * Lua 5.2 or higher
                
        The code right now assumes you'll be running this under Apache.
        
COMPILATION

        You'll need to install my CGILIB library (8.0.8 or higher) to
        compile this blog software.  You can install it from
        
                https://github.com/spc476/CGILib
                
        To install it once it's downloaded, all it should take is "make" and
        then "make install" as root.  The library assumes a POSIX
        environment and should compile as is on most modern Unix systems.
        
        Once that is installed, you should be able to do a "make" and
        generate the blog engine.  It's built as a setuid program to avoid
        having a world-writable directory, but if that is a concern, you can
        certain remove the setuid'ness of it, but make sure the data
        directories are writable by Apache.
        
        
INSTALLATION

        The assumption on the blog engine is that the executable resides in
        a directory visible to Apache and runnable from within Apache's
        docroot for the the site in question.  I have my copy named as
        "boston.cgi" and Apache configured to execute such programs via CGI.
        The htdocs/ subdirectory contains a sample website to run the blog.
        There's also a sample htaccess file that shows the method I use to
        run the blog engine.
        
        In the journal/ subdirectory is out-of-band files (which should not
        be served up by Apache).  There you will find a sample configuration
        file and a sample entry to see how the data is stored (each entry is
        a separate file, stored under a Year/Month/Day directory structure).
        
        The HTML entry form works, but it's not my primary method for new
        entries---for that, I use the program with the PUT method.  Check
        the sample configuration file for how that is set up.  There's a
        sample script written in Lua that uses PUT to add entries.  Not much
        documentation yet.  Sorry.

	I also support new entries via email.  I have the following line in
        '/etc/aliases':
        
                myjournal: "/path/to/boston.cgi --config /path/to/config --email --cmd new"
                
        To make an entry, I format an email to the journal address as:
        
                +-----[top of file]----------------------------
                |author: [who you set at author---exact match]
                |title: [title of entry]
                |class: [keywords]
                |status: [status repeated on Facebook]
		|adtag: [keyword used for advertising network]
                |
                |body of entry, usually including HTML
                | ...
                +----------------------------------------------
                
        And that's pretty much it.
        
        Good luck.

So,
in writing =syslogintr= I thought,
//This is going to be /incredible!/\ //
But in reality,
things were +pretty good+ bad.
And by ``bad,'' I meant /bad./
Okay, *really bad.*
<!-- well, it's not <em>quite</em> so bad as I make it out to be,
but it's still mildly inconvenient. -->
You can read about it
[[http://www.conman.org/people/spc/?one=two&three=four][here at this link]].
There's also [[gopher://floodgap.org/][this link]] and then

When writing HTML,
I thought I might do some code---<span lang="fr" title="um ...">merde</span>:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
  /* This contains no HTML at all */
  puts("Hello, world!");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
#+END_SRC

-----

* This is a sub heading ...

And here we have a table of data:

#+BEGIN_TABLE Some data goes here
*foo	bar	baz
**foo	bar	baz
3	14	15
92	62	82
8	-1	4
#+END_TABLE

So this is the end of the test.
But I have *strong* reservations about /stuff./
And I want to make a **strong** statement about AT&amp;T<-27&deg;.

``View -> Page Style -> No Style'' is the menu item to select.

#+BEGIN_TABLE
1	2	3	4
5	6	7	8
9	10	11	12
#+END_TABLE

My location: 27&deg;15&prime;37&Prime;N
80&deg;32&prime;3&Prime;W.  Shoot me down.

Hi Sean,

some other people (from {{example.com}}) have ideas regarding encrypted Gopher
(I will only throw some links at you, I'm feeling a little bit uncomfortable
writing longer english texts):

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  Even with all the {{redactions}}.

Here's a post about it:

In my opinion, the point where HTTP and HTML “went off the rails” into the
current trainwreck of the modern web happened when browsers gained the
ability to run code within the browser, turning the browser from a content
delivery platform and into an application delivery platform (althought that
transformation didn't happen overnight).  And no, it wasn't the fault of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape][Netscape]] and their introduction
of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript][Javascript]] that brought
about the current apocalypse of bloated webpages and constant surveillance.
Nope, the fault lies directly at the feet of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems][Sun Microsystems]] (whose
zombie corpse is following the command of
[[https://www.oracle.com/sun/][Oracle]] but I digress) and the introduction
of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)#History][Java in
early 1996]].  Javascript was Netscape's reaction to Java.

So {{an unknown caller calls me, only this one leaves me voice mail.  Usually
when that happens, it's because it's someone I know calling from an unknown
number or the car dealership telling me}} my car is ready or something along
those lines.

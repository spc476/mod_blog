So,
in writing =syslogintr= I thought,
//This is going to be /incredible!/\ //
But in reality,
things were +pretty good+ bad.
And by ``bad,'' I meant /bad./
Okay, *really bad.*
You can read about it
[[http://www.conman.org/people/spc/?one=two&three=four][here at this link]].

When writing HTML,
I thought I might do some code---<span lang="fr" title="um ...">merde</span>:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
  /* This contains no HTML at all */
  puts("Hello, world!");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
#+END_SRC

-----

* This is a sub heading ...

And here we have a table of data:

#+BEGIN_TABLE Some data goes here
*foo	bar	baz
**foo	bar	baz
3	14	15
92	62	82
8	-1	4
#+END_TABLE

So this is the end of the test.
But I have *strong* reservations about /stuff./
And I want to make a **strong** statement about AT&amp;T<-27&deg;.

``View -> Page Style -> No Style'' is the menu item to select.

#+BEGIN_TABLE
1	2	3	4
5	6	7	8
9	10	11	12
#+END_TABLE

My location: 27&deg;15&prime;37&Prime;N
80&deg;32&prime;3&Prime;W.  Shoot me down.

Hi Sean,

some other people (from {{example.com}}) have ideas regarding encrypted Gopher
(I will only throw some links at you, I'm feeling a little bit uncomfortable
writing longer english texts):
#+END_EMAIL

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  Even with all the {{redactions}}.

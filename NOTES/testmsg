So,
in writing =syslogintr= I thought,
//This is going to be /incredible!/\ //
But in reality,
things were +pretty good+ bad.
And by ``bad,'' I meant /bad./
Okay, *really bad.*
You can read about it

When writing HTML,
I thought I might do some code---<span lang="fr" title="um ...">merde</span>:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
  /* This contains no HTML at all */
  puts("Hello, world!");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
#+END_SRC

---

* This is a sub heading ...

And here we have a table of data:

#+BEGIN_TABLE Some data goes here
*foo	bar	baz
**foo	bar	baz
3	14	15
92	62	82
8	-1	4
#+END_TABLE

So this is the end of the test.
But I have *strong* reservations about /stuff./
And I want to make a **strong** statement about AT&amp;T&larr;27&deg;.

	scan-build (static analysis program) found that nu2 (in
	tumbler_page()) was being set, but not used.  I have a feeling that
	this indicates a bug, but one that hasn't manefested itself in over
	twelve years of use.  Or it could be that the feature this is
	intended to support is *so* esoteric that it never was an issue to
	begin with.

	I may have to use the tumbler code I wrote in Lua.

	globals_free() fails when calling BlogFree()---I think it's due to
	the way I cache records, using an array.  They're removed later on
	in the code via BlogEntryFree(), but they aren't marked as being
	removed from the blog cache.  That's causing the issue.  I wonder if
	I may have to reference count these things, or think of another way
	of handling this.

	This is no longer a bug.  It has been fixed by rewriting the core
	routines to read/write blog entries.

	generate_pages() trashes the Request structure.  Never noticed until
	now ...

	I started looking into this, but seem to have been sidetracked.  I'm
	not sure if it's such a deal now.  I'll keep the bug open for now.

	I'm not sure if this is still happening or not.  I suspect it was
	happening due to the BlogFree()/BlogEntryFree() issue.  Unless it
	shows itself, I think I'm going to consider this bug squashed for
	now.

	http://boston.conman.org/2005/12/10 defaulted to the default
	adtag, but http://boston.conman.org/2005/12/10.1 did not.  Need
	to follow the paths and see what happened ...

	Can't reproduce, so closing the bug.

20041228.1

	If the author, title or class isn't specified in the email, a
	default is provided, but it *isn't* allocated from the heap.  Either
	I need to set the defaults by coping, or check before calling
	BlogDayFree().  Blarg ...

	Allocating the fields from heap.  Have been doing so for quite some
	time now ...

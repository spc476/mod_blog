	oops, I can't really use a struct tm for a request field, as it
	doesn't have a field for which entry.  For a hack I can use tm_hour
	to pass back that info temporarily.  God this is turning into a
	large hack.

	What to do if the user requests 2000/4/3.8-6 when there are only
	four entries in 4/3?  Or just the one?  If just the one, return 404,
	but for a range?  Redirect to a known advanced date is probably the
	Right Thing.  Yet another thing to keep in mind.

	Had I made an unwarrented assumption?  Just because I've done stuff
	like href="2000/3/4.2" doesn't mean I couldn't reference something
	like href="2000/3/4.2-7".  So now, if the reference is ``onpage,''
	then we can translate it to:

		href="#2000/3/4.2-7"

	Or should we?  Shouldn't it be:

		href=#2000/3/4.2?

	Assuming we put in <a name=""></a> tags.  But there could be
	overlap, say onpage is 2000/1/1-15 and inside is reference to
	2000/1/13-18.  There is overlap but it's not the entire item,
	so in that case, we shouldn't include an internal anchor link,
	but a full link.  

	So, given two tumblers, we need to decide if one is inside
	another.  Interesting problem ... It looks similar to line clipping,
	if you want to clip one dimentional lines.  It might be prudent
	to calculate the Julian Day for each entry (make it fractional for
	the parts) so comparrisons can be done easier.

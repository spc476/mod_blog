	Some quick notes on adding the archive section.  Create
	"cmd=archive" with parameters "unit=MONTH|DAY".  For "unit=MONTH",
	pick up the "date" parameter (should only be year).  If not defined,
	list out each year, with each month listed and linked---otherwise,
	do just the year listed.  for 'unit=DAY', 'date' should be YYYY/MM,
	go through, and for each day of the month, list out the title and
	link to the article.

	The robots META tags should read "noindex, follow".

	Also, it's not an archive section, it's an overview section.  Rename
	the command appropriately.

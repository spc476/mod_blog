	Add code to translate HTML entities in the title field to numeric
	HTML entities because RSS (and presumedly Atom) consumers don't
	understand the named HTML entities.

	Extend the "ad word" feature to *not* URL encode it, so I can throw
	it into the Google search box on the sidebar.

	Add an "ad word" feature.  For each entry, take the tags, add them
	all together.  Then, pick a random word from that list, weighted,
	according to how many times each tag appears.  Then use that to tag
	the advertisement (say, Amazon).

	Actually, we don't need to weight them ... just separate out the
	(long) string of comma separated tags, then pick one at random.  The
	tag that appears most often will, statistically speaking, be picked
	more often.
